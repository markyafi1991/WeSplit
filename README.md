# WeSplit

A hobby project built while learning iOS development using [Hacking with Swift](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/).  
This app demonstrates the basics of building forms, working with user input, and performing simple calculations in SwiftUI.

## ðŸ“± About the App

**WeSplit** is a simple bill-splitting calculator that:

- Accepts a total bill amount
- Allows the user to enter the number of people
- Lets the user select a tip percentage
- Calculates how much each person should pay

It's designed as a beginner-friendly app to practice SwiftUI components such as:

- `Form`
- `TextField`
- `Picker`
- `State` and `Binding`
- Basic arithmetic logic in Swift

## ðŸ›  Technologies Used

- Swift
- SwiftUI
- Xcode
- macOS

## ðŸš€ Getting Started

To run the project locally:

1. Open the project in Xcode.
2. Make sure you're using a recent version of Xcode that supports SwiftUI.
3. Run the app using the iOS simulator.

## ðŸ’¡ What I Learned

- How to use `@State` to manage form input
- How to bind user input to SwiftUI views
- How to create computed properties for dynamic UI updates
- How to use `Picker` for user selections

## ðŸ“š Source

This project is based on the **WeSplit** tutorial from the [100 Days of SwiftUI](https://www.hackingwithswift.com/100/swiftui) series by Paul Hudson.
